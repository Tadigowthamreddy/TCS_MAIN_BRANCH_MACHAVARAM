            Nuclear missiles are powerful weapons that use nuclear reactions to create explosive energy. These missiles are designed to deliver nuclear warheads to a target, causing massive destruction and loss of life. India's former president, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, played a pivotal role in the development of India's missile technology. Under his guidance, India successfully tested and deployed a range of missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. His vision and leadership were instrumental in ensuring that India had a credible nuclear deterrent, enhancing national security. The advancements made in missile technology under his stewardship have positioned India as a significant player in global defense. Dr. Kalam's legacy continues to inspire innovation and technological development in India.
